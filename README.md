###  DataCamp Referral Program For B2B Customers

:moneybag: :dollar:

DataCamp is offering a special promotion where instructors can earn a referral fee for introducing DataCamp to new prospects.

* You receive a 15% revenue share on the initial contract we sign with your referral (For example if you refer a financial service company that buys $30,000 worth of DataCamp subscriptions, we would pay you $4,500)
* **Referrals are very easy to make and all you need to do is fill out [this referral form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb9tGdH3akd2VA1uQpdftc218K_tEKhIUxAogYZoiH7zdPbg/viewform)**
* This referral opportunity is in addition to the royalty payments you already receive
* The primary target is businesses but we also sell to government agencies and graduate programs at universities
